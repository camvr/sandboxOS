# sandboxOS
A bare-bones kernel for developed from scratch purely for educational/entertainment purposes and to explore my interest in operating systems.

## Development
The kernel is written in C++ using gcc cross-compiled for i686-ELF. Therefore, you must have compile gcc for i686-ELF. For specific steps, refer to http://wiki.osdev.org/GCC_Cross-Compiler.



## Resources
Much of the kernel is developed referencing [osdev.org](http://wiki.osdev.org/Main_Page) for its excellent resources and community guides. Certainly a great starting place for anyone looking into operating system development.

Some resources in particular used are as follows:
